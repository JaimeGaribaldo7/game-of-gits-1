House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Unfortunately, GRRM is a hateful person and honor never works for anyone so
Ned loses his head and dies. Bummer.
