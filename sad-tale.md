House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned then went to King's Landing and everyone was so impressed with how great he
was, they made him king and everyone lived happily every after.
